    <p>There is where it's supposed to be my little presentation</p>
    <p>I've never really liked to lock my person in a description but sometimes it is necessary to do so. 
        My name is Dovile, I'm Lithuanian and I've lived in Italy for 21 years. My passion for programming was born when I attended university, graduating in Communication Sciences. 
        In this course I was lucky enough to attend programming classes and something in my mind lit up. The topic definitely captured my interest and a few years later I decided that this was my path. 
        I quit my old part-time job to totally immerse myself in the Strive School course with the hope of changing my life and turning it into something I really want.</p>
